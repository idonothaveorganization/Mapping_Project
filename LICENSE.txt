Unofficial "Human" English below (unofficial/informal/legally non-binding):

My entire goal in releasing this software is to help advance research in this area.
That means I intend it to be open for academic, personal, and hobby use
(including, for example, school hackathons or university research).

If you think you might not be able to use this software for academic research
because (for example) your use might be legally fall under "commercial" use,
please contact me so we can find a solution, because my entire intention is that
this software be open for research. If it's not, it's defeating my entire goal.

Regarding commercial use:
This is probably a moot point because I honestly don't see this software as
production-quality and I think it's unlikely anyone can monetize it,
but if you would nevertheless like to use it commercially, please contact me,
and I'd obviously be very happy to work out a license that works with you.

Cheers!
