    "In urban roads, travel times vary a lot due to a lot of factors such as varying traffic density, pedestrain crossings, etc. In such cases, it makes sense to model travel time on each edge as a random variable rather than a deterministic quantity. There are many ways we can model the travel time as a random variable, some of which consider the existing dependency between travel time of different edges. For now, we assume that the travel time between different edges are independent. \n",

    "We can obtain the distribution of the random variable modeling the travel time on an edge using collected data. For now, lets assume that the travel time on any edge can be modeled as a Gaussian random variable which is parametrized by a mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$. We can estimate the mean and variance from travel time samples on an edge. Note that, because of the independence assumption we made in the above paragraph, all these random variables are independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a bunch of ways we could obtain raw data to estimate the $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ of the travel time distribution on an edge. Some of them are not easy, and some other might not have data specific to Champaign Urbana. To get started, we generate synthetic data for mean and variance of travel time on each edge below and store it in the original networkx file."

    "For a given travel time budget $\\tau$, the reliability of a route $R$ from origin to destination can be given as the probability of reaching the destination within the given travel time budget using that route. Recall that we have distributions of travel time on individual edges and a route is basically a series of edges. Since we assumed that the random variables are independent, the travel time distribution of a route can be defined as the sum of random variables defining the travel time on the edges that constitute the route, $T_R = T_{e_1} + T_{e_2} + ... + T_{e_n}$. Given that we have independent Gaussian random variables modeling the travel time on each edge, the parameters of the travel time distribution of the route can be given as \n",
